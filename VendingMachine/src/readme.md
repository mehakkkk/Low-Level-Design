# Vending Machine System - Concurrency Review & Recommendations (Latest with ThreadLocal)

## ✅ Overview
This vending machine system allows for product selection, payment, and dispensing in a thread-safe manner. The latest design uses `ThreadLocal` to manage per-thread state, ensuring that transactions do not interfere with each other.

## ✅ Concurrency Handling Review

### 1. Product.java
- Uses `AtomicInteger` for product quantity.
- `decrementQuantity()` ensures atomic decrements.
- **Conclusion:** Safe for concurrent access.

### 2. Inventory.java
- Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` to store products.
- Thread-safe product retrieval and quantity management.
- **Conclusion:** Concurrency handled effectively.

### 3. VendingMachine.java
- Replaces shared `selectedProduct` with `ThreadLocal<Product>`.
- Each thread has its own product selection context.
- Reduces lock contention and avoids shared state corruption.
- No redundant synchronized blocks.
- **Conclusion:** Strong concurrency design with high scalability.

### 4. State Classes
- `RenderState`, `TransactState`, `DispenseState`, and `ReadyState` remain stateless.
- Only contain logic and printing; no shared mutable state.
- **Conclusion:** Completely thread-safe.

### 5. VendingMachineDemo.java
- Spawns multiple threads to simulate concurrent vending operations.
- Reads are currently interactive; for pure concurrency testing, replace user input with preset selections.
- **Recommendation:** Use hardcoded product selection and payments for automated thread testing.

## ✅ Concurrency Test Recommendations
- Example hardcoded flow in each thread:
  ```java
  vendingMachine.selectProduct(new Product(0, "kurkure", 2, 0));
  vendingMachine.makePayment(20);
  vendingMachine.dispenseProduct();
  ```
- Run multiple threads simultaneously to stress-test thread isolation.

| Scenario                                                  | Handled?                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Multiple threads selecting products simultaneously        | ✅ Managed by ThreadLocal                     |
| Concurrent depletion of product quantity                  | ✅ Atomic operations ensure correctness        |
| State leak or incorrect carryover between threads         | ✅ Each thread has isolated state via ThreadLocal |
| Concurrent dispense or payment collisions                 | ✅ States and inventory operations are independent per thread |

## ✅ Future Improvement Suggestions
- Add logging with thread names for easier debug tracing.
- Include exception handling for invalid selections or low quantity.
- Provide automated JUnit tests simulating concurrent purchases.

## ✅ Conclusion
The current use of `ThreadLocal` for state handling, combined with `ConcurrentHashMap` and `AtomicInteger` in the inventory, provides a solid concurrency-safe implementation. The vending machine is now capable of handling parallel operations efficiently without performance bottlenecks or state corruption.
