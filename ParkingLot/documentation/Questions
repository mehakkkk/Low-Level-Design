1) Why did you choose to use interfaces for SlotStrategy and PaymentStrategy?

They may want to understand your reasoning for using the Strategy pattern and how it promotes flexibility and reusability.
Can you explain the relationship between ParkingLot, Slot, and Vehicle?

This question checks your understanding of object composition and associations.

2) How does your design adhere to the SOLID principles?

Be prepared to explain how your design adheres to principles like Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Dependency Inversion.

3) Why did you use a TreeSet for NaturalOrderSlots and a Queue for FirstComeFirstServe?

The interviewer may be interested in your understanding of data structures and their suitability for specific use cases.
Why did you choose to use a Map<String, Slot> for storing parking slots?

They may ask this to evaluate your choice of data structure for efficient retrieval and management of slots.
Scalability & Extensibility

4) How would you scale this system to support multiple parking lots?

This question is to understand your thoughts on scalability and how your design could handle a larger scope.
If you had to add a new type of slot or vehicle, how would your design accommodate it?

They may ask this to see if your design is easily extendable.

5) How would your design handle high concurrency, such as multiple vehicles parking or leaving simultaneously?

The interviewer might want to know how your design deals with concurrency and synchronization.
If the parking lot system needed to support reservations, how would you modify your design?

This question tests your ability to adapt the design to new requirements.
Error Handling & Edge Cases

6) What happens if a vehicle tries to park when the lot is full?

They may ask about your error-handling strategy, such as throwing exceptions or returning error codes.
How does your system handle invalid tickets, such as those that have expired or been tampered with?

This checks your robustness in handling edge cases and ensuring system integrity.

7) What would happen if a vehicle parks without being assigned a slot? How does your design prevent this?

This tests the safeguards in your system design.

8) How does the system deal with overstay scenarios?

They may ask this to explore how you handle vehicles that overstay their allotted time.
Payment & Business Logic

9) How does your design accommodate different payment methods, and what would be the process for adding a new one?

They’re likely testing the flexibility of your payment system.

10) What would happen if a payment fails during the unpark process?

This is to see how you handle failed transactions and whether the vehicle is allowed to leave.

11) Can you explain how discounts or promotions could be integrated into your payment system?

They may ask this to see how well your system can adapt to changing business requirements.
Design Patterns & Best Practices

12) Why did you decide not to use certain design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory) in your design?

They might want to hear your reasoning for excluding certain patterns and whether you’re aware of their pros and cons.

13) How would you ensure that the ParkingLotService class does not become too large and unmanageable?

This question is about adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle and avoiding a "God object."
Performance & Efficiency

14) What is the time complexity of parking a vehicle in the NaturalOrderSlots strategy?

They may ask this to test your knowledge of the performance implications of your data structure choices.

15) How does your design optimize for quick retrieval of available slots?

This could involve discussing how your data structures and algorithms contribute to efficient operations.

16) How would you optimize your system if you had to handle a very large number of vehicles and slots?

This tests your ability to think about performance optimization in large-scale scenarios.
Miscellaneous & Open-Ended Questions
What are some potential real-world issues that your design might encounter? How would you address them?

This is to see how well you can anticipate and plan for challenges.
If you were given more time, what improvements or features would you add to this design?

This question assesses your ability to prioritize and think critically about future enhancements.
How would you ensure the security and integrity of the parking lot system?

They might ask this to evaluate your understanding of security concerns, such as preventing fraud in payment or tampering with tickets.
Can you walk through the process flow from when a vehicle enters the parking lot to when it leaves?

This helps the interviewer understand your end-to-end process flow and how all components interact.
Behavioral Questions Related to the Design
Was there any part of the design you found particularly challenging? How did you overcome it?

This question might be used to understand your problem-solving process.
If a team member suggested a completely different approach to the design, how would you handle that?

This is to gauge your ability to collaborate and accept feedback.
